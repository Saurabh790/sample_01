Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path '/caseentrybatch'
Quartz scheduler started
casebatchJobTrigger set up with Cron Expression 0 0 0/4 ? * * *
Started CaseEntryBatchApplication
So the app is running. The only reason you’re not seeing “batch output” is because the job is scheduled every 4 hours and may not have hit its schedule yet, or there’s no data in CA_UNIVERSE_BATCH_T to process.

What is most likely happening
Quartz trigger is working, but it runs at 0 0 0/4 ? * * *
That means: every 4 hours at minute 0.
If you started at 12:29, the first run would be 16:00, not immediately.

No batch rows are available, so even when it runs, it won’t create cases.

How to confirm if it’s running
You can do any of the following:

Option A — Change cron to run every minute (temp):
Update CASE_CONFIG value for BATCH_CASE_ENTRY_SCHEDULE to something like:

0 0/1 * ? * * *
Then restart the app and watch logs.

Option B — Manually call the service
If you have a controller or can run a Spring Bean manually, trigger:

iCaseBatchService.createBatchCase()
Option C — Check DB
Verify that CA_UNIVERSE_BATCH_T has rows where REC_MATCH_IND is null (that’s what your repo uses).

About the warnings
These are not fatal:

Logback Janino warning: only a warning about older config.
Netty version mismatch: warning only, usually safe unless you see runtime errors.
Tell me what output you expected
Just tell me which of these is “missing”:

You expected the batch to run immediately.
You expected output (records) but nothing appears in DB.
You expected emails and didn’t get them.
Once you tell me which one, I’ll give exact fixes with SQL + config.





If CA_UNIVERSE_BATCH_T has rows where REC_MATCH_IND is null, then

1. Data Flow (what gets created)
The job reads from CA_UNIVERSE_BATCH_T, validates those records against Snowflake DM_CLAIM_DRUG_T, then creates case data in your SQL Server tables.

to below

CA_INTELLIGENT_KEY_T
CA_GENERAL_T
CA_PROVIDER_T or CA_RECIPIENT_T
CA_INVST_PRELIMINARY_T or CA_INVST_FULLSCALE_T
Claim tracking tables:
CA_CLAIM_LIST_T
CA_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS_T
CA_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS_HIST_T
And it also populates:

CA_UNIVERSE_T (validated and enriched entries)
So the output is new database rows, not files.

2. Emails
will explicitly sends emails after:

Successful batch completion (BATCH_SUCCESS_NOTIFICATION)
Assignment (BATCH_ASSIGNMENT_NOTIFICATION)
Failures (BATCH_FAIL_NOTIFICATION_USER/ADMIN)
Invalid claims (BATCH_INVALID_NOTIFICATION_USER)
These are sent via:

Azure Logic App or
SMTP server
So expected output includes emails (if config is set).

3. Invalid/Duplicate behavior
If any record:

Doesn’t exist in Snowflake
Has wrong participant mapping
Is a duplicate TCN+Line
Then:

It flags that row in CA_UNIVERSE_BATCH_T
Sends an invalid claims email
Does NOT create case records




CA_UNIVERSE_T → new rows
CA_INTELLIGENT_KEY_T → new case ids
CA_GENERAL_T, CA_PROVIDER_T, CA_RECIPIENT_T
CA_CLAIM_LIST_T, CA_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS_T, CA_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS_HIST_T
If those tables have new data → batch ran successfully.
