Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path '/caseentrybatch'
Quartz scheduler started
casebatchJobTrigger set up with Cron Expression 0 0 0/4 ? * * *
Started CaseEntryBatchApplication
So the app is running. The only reason you’re not seeing “batch output” is because the job is scheduled every 4 hours and may not have hit its schedule yet, or there’s no data in CA_UNIVERSE_BATCH_T to process.

What is most likely happening
Quartz trigger is working, but it runs at 0 0 0/4 ? * * *
That means: every 4 hours at minute 0.
If you started at 12:29, the first run would be 16:00, not immediately.

No batch rows are available, so even when it runs, it won’t create cases.

How to confirm if it’s running
You can do any of the following:

Option A — Change cron to run every minute (temp):
Update CASE_CONFIG value for BATCH_CASE_ENTRY_SCHEDULE to something like:

0 0/1 * ? * * *
Then restart the app and watch logs.

Option B — Manually call the service
If you have a controller or can run a Spring Bean manually, trigger:

iCaseBatchService.createBatchCase()
Option C — Check DB
Verify that CA_UNIVERSE_BATCH_T has rows where REC_MATCH_IND is null (that’s what your repo uses).

About the warnings
These are not fatal:

Logback Janino warning: only a warning about older config.
Netty version mismatch: warning only, usually safe unless you see runtime errors.
Tell me what output you expected
Just tell me which of these is “missing”:

You expected the batch to run immediately.
You expected output (records) but nothing appears in DB.
You expected emails and didn’t get them.
Once you tell me which one, I’ll give exact fixes with SQL + config.
