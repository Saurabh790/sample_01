Netplex Json-smart 2.5.0 through 2.5.1 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker can trigger a stack exhaustion by loading a specially crafted JSON input that contains a large number of '{' characters. This vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-1370. [Generated by AI]




The 'MadeYouReset' vulnerability is a logical flaw in the HTTP/2 protocol that exploits malformed control frames to bypass the maximum concurrent streams limit, leading to resource exhaustion and potential distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This issue affects implementations of HTTP/2, including the Netty framework prior to versions 4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final. The vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate the server's active streams counter by triggering RST_STREAM frames, enabling unbounded concurrent stream handling. [Generated by AI]
