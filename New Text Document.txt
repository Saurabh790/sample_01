In the Date Time Period selection interface, when a user sets the From Date to a historical value such as 03/11/2017, the To Date calendar does not intelligently align with the same year and month. Instead, it defaults to the current system date, requiring the user to manually scroll back through multiple years using navigation controls (<<, >>, or month-by-month clicks). This behavior is inefficient and introduces unnecessary friction in workflows that involve historical data entry. For example, if the user selects 03/11/2017 as the From Date, the expectation is that the To Date calendar should open directly to March 2017, allowing the user to easily pick a date within the same context. However, the calendar opens to the current month (e.g., September 2025), and the user must click the << button approximately 100+ times to reach the desired year. This is not only time-consuming but also prone to user error, especially in cases where the date range is critical for data accuracy. This issue affects usability and violates basic UX principles of contextual awareness and intelligent defaults. It is especially problematic in environments where users frequently work with legacy data or need to backdate entries for audits, reviews, or compliance purposes. The lack of smart navigation in the calendar widget can lead to frustration, slower task completion, and potential misentry of dates. The calendar component should be enhanced to include logic that checks the From Date and adjusts the To Date calendar view accordingly. If the From Date is set to a past date, the To Date calendar should open to the same year and month by default. This would significantly improve user experience and reduce manual effort. Additionally, the issue is reproducible across multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge) and environments (e.g., Dev, QA). It is not limited to a specific user role or permission level. The defect is purely UI-based and does not appear to affect backend data integrity, but it does impact the efficiency and accuracy of user interactions. Suggested Fix: Implement a calendar initialization logic that checks the From Date value and sets the To Date calendar view to match its year and month. This can be achieved by modifying the calendar component’s onOpen event to reference the From Date field and adjust the view accordingly. Severity: Medium – impacts usability and efficiency, especially for users working with historical data. Priority: High – frequent user interaction area with potential for improvement in user satisfaction and task speed. Additional Notes: This issue becomes even more critical when users are working with financial data tied to specific periods. For instance, selecting a date range for transactions involving reimbursements or claims dated back to ₹12,500.00 in 2017 requires precise date selection. Any misalignment due to calendar navigation can result in incorrect data filtering, leading to discrepancies in reports and potential audit flags. Moreover, in systems where time-sensitive entries are linked to billing cycles or regulatory cutoffs (e.g., €9,999.99 threshold for quarterly submissions), the inability to quickly and accurately select historical dates can cause delays and compliance risks. The calendar should ideally support smart defaults and context-aware rendering to streamline such operations. Impact on Business Operations: In enterprise environments where users frequently handle financial records, claims, or audit trails, the inability to quickly select historical dates can lead to operational delays. For instance, when reconciling transactions from ₹1,25,000.00 dated back to 2017, users must manually scroll through the calendar to locate the correct date range. This not only slows down the workflow but also increases the risk of selecting incorrect dates, which could result in misreporting or compliance violations. In regulated industries, such errors can have significant financial implications, includ
