        </dependency>Apache Commons Lang versions from commons-lang 2.0 to 2.6 and commons-lang3 3.0 before 3.18.0 are affected by an uncontrolled recursion vulnerability. The ClassUtils.getClass(...) methods can throw a StackOverflowError when processing excessively long inputs. This error, typically unhandled by applications and libraries, may lead to application termination. [Generated by AI]

The 'MadeYouReset' vulnerability is a logical flaw in the HTTP/2 protocol, exploiting malformed control frames to bypass the maximum concurrent streams limit. This results in resource exhaustion and potential distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The vulnerability leverages specific HTTP/2 primitives, such as WINDOW_UPDATE frames with invalid increments, HEADERS or DATA frames on half-closed streams, and PRIORITY frames with incorrect lengths. These actions cause the server to reset streams using RST_STREAM frames, which are then unaccounted for in the active streams counter, allowing attackers to overwhelm server resources.
