1. Work Completed Last Week

US9183406: Worked on Task TA29323245, including multiple pull requests that addressed key functional and code improvements related to this user story.

Coordinated with the team for code reviews and incorporated feedback to align with project standards.

Initiated setup of the UI Analytics project. Faced environment setup issues and, following Siddarth’s guidance, raised a help desk ticket for technical assistance — this ticket is still in progress.

2. Planned Work for This Week

Complete the UI Analytics project setup once support issues are resolved.

Ensure all pending PRs under US9183406 (TA29323245) are merged into the development branch.

Conduct thorough unit testing and then promote the changes to higher environments (e.g., QA, UAT).

Perform regression validation to confirm that recent updates do not impact other modules.

3. Challenges / Roadblocks

Encountered technical setup issues while configuring the UI Analytics project — currently awaiting help desk resolution.

Dependency on external support teams has slightly delayed progress for environment setup.

Need better documentation or guidance on internal project setup procedures to streamline onboarding and configuration.

4. Suggestions for Improvement

Improved documentation and setup guides for project environments to reduce dependency on help desk tickets.

Faster turnaround for support tickets or a dedicated contact point for development environment issues.

Regular short syncs or check-ins could help unblock issues faster and ensure better coordination.

5. Plans to Improve Velocity and Quality

Will proactively leverage GitHub CoPilot to accelerate code development and improve code quality.

Spend additional time to deeply understand business requirements before implementation to reduce rework.

Continue maintaining unit test coverage and adopt early validation to detect defects sooner.

Improve task planning by breaking large stories into smaller deliverables to ensure consistent progress.
